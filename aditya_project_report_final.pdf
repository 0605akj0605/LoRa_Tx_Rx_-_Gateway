# 🌐 Prototype of a Multi-Node LoRa IoT System with Cloud-Connected Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring

![LoRa Network](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/placeholder/network-architecture.png)

## 📑 Project Summary

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **LoRa-based environmental monitoring system** using a **multi-node architecture**, capable of **long-range, low-power communication**, with data being pushed to the cloud in real time. It includes:
- LoRa-based sensor end-nodes built with **Wio-E5 dev boards** and **DHT11 sensors**
- A central **LoRa gateway** integrated with **ESP8266** for Wi-Fi connectivity
- Cloud backend using **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + REST API)
- Real-time dashboard with **Next.js**, **Leaflet.js**, and **Chart.js**
